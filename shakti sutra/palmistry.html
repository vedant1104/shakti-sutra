<h1 style="color: #306 "> Palm Reading </h1>
<p>Palm Reading is an ancient occult science which had its origins in <strong> Babylon, India, China, Sumeria and Ancient Israel</strong>. Fortune telling is done by studying the lines, symbols present in the palm of the hand, the shape of the hand and fingers, etc. The hand acts as the gateway to the person’s past, present and future experiences and much can be known about the subject by following ancient palm reading techniques. The heart line, the head line, the life line are among the major lines that are studied commonly in palm reading. There are several more such lines on the palm which are equally important and should be analyzed for an accurate understanding of the person. Aristotle had observed, “Lines are not written into the human hand without reason.” It couldn’t be truer. The lines have great significance in astrology and astrology enthusiasts will find this science to be highly fascinating.
<br />
<br />

<strong>Palmistry</strong> - Variations exist across schools of Palmistry in the interpretations and beliefs of the shapes of palms, palm lines, hands, etc.

  <br />
  <input name="radio1" type="radio" value="" checked="checked" /> <strong> Pragmatic </strong>
  <p>The pragmatic hand is easy to spot by its square or rectangular shape and square-shaped fingers. The knuckles are smooth or slightly knotty. The palm is almost equal in length and breadth, and is usually quite stiff. The hand is very firm in texture, even hard sometimes. It has a solid feel about it. The skin quality varies from very coarse to moderately fine.

  <p>The palm has a bony, narrow feel and the well defined knotty joints are the vital features of the analytical hand. The fingers are usually long, but the distinctive feature is the enlarged or knotty knuckles. The hand is a little dry to the touch, and sometimes it feels cool.</p>
